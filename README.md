An AI powered log analyzer to ensure the below security compliance in Log files
My idea is to analyze log files of Aleo transactions done with aleo commands and provide identity and security analytics on the data

1. System of Record (SOR) :

- Information storage and retrieval system 
- Multiple data sources with remote access.
- Log Data Storage in a generalized format

2. Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) :
- Threat and vulnerability management, incident response and security operations automation
- Automatic execution of tasks like vulnerability Scan , log File Insights

3. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) :
- Solution that helps organizations recognize potential security threats and vulnerabilities
- It surfaces user behavior anomalies and uses Machine Learning Algorithms
- Automate manual processes associated with threat detection and incident response
